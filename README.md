# XMPP Sample for android

Hi guys, I have made one sample for xmpp. Its Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol(XMPP) is a communication protocol for messge-oriented middleware based on XML(Extensible Markup Language).

You need to follow few steps and you get it done in very simple way.

Step 1. If you are try in locally then you have to install wamp or lamp or xampp server. After this start the server apache and mysql. Now you have import openfire database in mysql.

Step 2. Install openfire in your system.If you are trying in local otherwise you can install openfire in your server.

Step 3. Go to below link of github to download my sample for xmpp.
